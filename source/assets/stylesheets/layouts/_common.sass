/* See _common.sass for CSS style help. */

// Quickstart for Sass syntax:

// Take everything in your CSS inside the {}, delete the {} and indent it. 
// Delete the closing ; and instead user a newline. 
// @include, $blue, etc are instructions to the Sass precompiler. 
// Coments are full line. /* this passes through to CSS */ but // doesn't. 
// Otherwise, it's just CSS. 

// Quickstart for Block__Element--Modifier class naming: 

// .block is the higher level of an abstraction or component.
// .block__element is a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.
// .block--modifier is a different state or version of .block.
// This works best when applied to layout concerns.

// Quickstart for modular CSS: 

// Use small-scope classes, rather than mega class + nesting, to keep definitions reusable. 
// Never blend presentation (".subhead"), layout (".popover"), and meaning (".alert-red")
// Even in BEM, that's a ".popover" with a ".subhead .alert-red" inside it. 
// Don't use .popover__subhead or .subhead--alert-red unless these are locked to that element layout.
