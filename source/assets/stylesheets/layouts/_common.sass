/* See _common.sass for CSS styleguide. */

// Quickstart for Sass syntax:

// Take everything in your CSS inside the {}, delete the {} and indent it. 
// Delete the closing ; and instead user a newline. 
// @include etc are instructions to the precompiler. 
// Coments are full line, not closed. /* passes through to CSS but // doesn't. 
// Otherwise, it's just CSS. 

// Quickstart for Block__Element--Modifier class naming: 

// .block is the higher level of an abstraction or component.
// .block__element is a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.
// .block--modifier is a different state or version of .block.

// Quickstart for modual CSS: 

// Use small-scope classes, rather than mega class + nesting, to keep elements modular. 
// Seperate presentation ("headline"), layout ("popover"), and meaning ("alert-red")
